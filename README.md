[Mekawy'campus network]

This is my first network project, developed during my training in the Digital Egypt Pioneers Internship (DEPI).
The project demonstrates the implementation of Routing on a Stick, OSPF, Layer 3 Switch Configuration, DHCP, and Cloud Service Integration to simulate a modern, scalable, and efficient network infrastructure.

üìã Project Features:-

Routing on a Stick: Configured for seamless inter-VLAN communication.

OSPF Protocol: Implemented for efficient and scalable routing between network devices.

Layer 3 Switch: Combined switching and routing functionality for optimized performance.

DHCP Service: Enabled dynamic IP allocation across multiple VLANs.

Cloud Service Integration: Incorporated to replicate real-world networking scenarios.
